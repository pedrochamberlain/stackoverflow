# Remote Work Satisfaction – Stack Overflow 

A data-based investigation on remote workers using Stack Overflow's developer survey data from 2017.

## Installation

All you'll need to run this project is Python 3.* installed in your device.

## Project Motivation

Using Stack Overflow data from 2017, I was interestested in answering the following questions concerning remote work:

- "Are remote workers more satisfied with their jobs?"
- "Do developers who work remotely earn the same as those who don't?"
- "Are remote workers generally more experienced individuals?"

## File Descriptions

I created a notebook for each of the questions above.

1. `JobSatisfaction.ipynb`
2. `Earnings.ipynb`
3. `CareerExperience.ipynb`

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at a [post I published on Medium](https://medium.com/@pedro.matos_10851/how-do-we-really-feel-about-working-remotely-d015b92821f8).
